# About Me — Natty Zepko

Hey! I’m **Natty Zepko** — a backend‑focused software engineer who loves building things that are useful, fun, and sometimes unnecessarily over‑engineered (on purpose). I enjoy clean architecture, elegant logic, making systems scalable (because I often come back to continue where I left off) and solving bugs that only appear when you stop looking at them.

Outside of work, I’m a huge fan of math, science, and astronomy. I also own a small, very old dog named Lady, have a chaotic sense of humor, and maintain full confidence that I *could* stop drinking coffee anytime… but realistically? I won’t.

I love playing story-rich games, dramatic stories, and games that require deep thinking. I'm awesome at GO, don't even try me!!

# 🚀 What I Do

I design and build backend systems, automation tools, real‑time event flows, and game‑like side projects. I focus on reliability, clarity, and developer‑friendly architecture. I usually try to make my projects scalable, if I ever want to expand. It pays off!

### **Technologies I Work With**

* **Backend:** Node.js, TypeScript, C#, Python
* **Databases:** MongoDB, SQL
* **APIs:** REST, WebSockets (Socket.io), real‑time events
* **DevOps / Infrastructure:** Docker, GitHub Actions, CI/CD pipelines, Linux containers
* **Testing:** Playwright, automated WebSocket testing, E2E flows
* **Other Interests:** Unity game development, AI, Fun coding problems (like in leetcode)

### **Programming Languages I Know**

C, C++, Java, Python, C#, Node.js, JavaScript

# 🕵️‍♂️ Project #1 — AI Murder Mystery

An AI‑powered interactive detective game where every playthrough creates a completely new story. The system dynamically generates suspects, clues, motives, and plot twists.

### **What It Does**

* Dynamically generated storylines using generative‑AI (EVERY TIME YOU PLAY - ITS A NEW STORY!)
* Interactive investigation flow and evolving narrative state
* Backend logic manages evidence, suspects, player actions, and scene transitions

### **How It’s Built**

* **Languages:** JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML
* **Tech Stack:** Node.js, Express, @google/gemini‑generative‑ai
* **Architecture:** Modular prompt/scene flow, stateful story management

# 🌌 Project #2 — Genshin TCG Tool

A full pipeline + frontend project for analyzing, scraping, organizing, and displaying "Genius Invokation TCG" card data from Genshin Impact.

### **What It Does**

* Scrapes and normalizes card data from external HTML sources
* Stores, versions, and syncs card information with structured logging
* Provides a modern React UI for filtering, searching, and managing decks
* Supports image caching, patch endpoints, and automatic updates

### **How It’s Built**

**Backend:**

* FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, SQLite/Postgres
* Pydantic v2, BeautifulSoup4, Requests
* Apscheduler, httpx, pytest

**Frontend:**

* React 18, JSX, Vite
* Lazy loaded assets and responsive UI patterns. Yup! I made that asset cache, I just don't like waiting.

**Languages:** Python, JavaScript/JSX

# 🤛🏼 Project #3 — VR Martial Arts Training

A VR training environment that recognizes martial‑arts hand motions like punch, hook, swing, and uppercut using ML and real‑time VR motion tracking.

### **What It Does**

* Provides interactive VR training scenarios
* Recognizes real hand motions using KNN‑based motion classification
* Includes example datasets created by two testers (me and Yonatan Stekliar)

### **How It’s Built**

* **Language:** C#
* **Engine:** Unity
* **VR Toolkit:** Unity XR, Oculus Quest 2 support
* **Machine Learning:** KNN classifier trained on dozens of captured motion sequences

# 🧠 Project #4 — Mastermind Solver

A Python implementation of the logic game "Mastermind" featuring both playable and auto‑solving modes using Knuth’s classic algorithm.

### **What It Does**

* Full Mastermind gameplay implementation
* Auto-solver mode finds solutions efficiently
* Clean Python structure suitable for learning and modification
* GUI with Tkinter. It uses recursion to add rows to the screen! How cool is that?!

### **How It’s Built**

* **Language:** Python
* **Frameworks:** Pure Python + Tkinter GUI
* **Design:** Modular, readable educational structure
